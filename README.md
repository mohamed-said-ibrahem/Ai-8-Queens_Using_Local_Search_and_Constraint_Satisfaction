## Ai-8-Queens_Using_Local_Search_and_Constraint_Satisfaction
##### Eight Queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other, thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## You should solve the 8-queens problem using the following algorithms:
#### 1) Hill Climbing Algorithm
#### 2) K-Beam Search Algorithm.
#### 3) Genetic Algorithm.
#### 4) Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).

#### Note That: The cost function for all algorithms will be the total number of attacking queen pairs. For example, the cost function for the above configuration is 28.
